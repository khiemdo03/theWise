One of Common Weakness Enumeration I chose is [**CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html). <br/> For instance: 
```
int id_sequence[3];

id_sequence[0] = 123;
id_sequence[1] = 234;
id_sequence[2] = 345;
id_sequence[3] = 456;
```
This weakness occurs when the code writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. This can lead to corruption of relevant memory and possibly lead to execution of arbitrary code or other unpredictable behavior.

The _fake_ Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) for my code could be represented as
`cpe:2.3:a:bell_labs:c:1.0:0:*:*:*:*:*:*` <br/> 
where 2.3 is the version of the CPE, ‘a’ represents an application, ‘bell_labs’ is the vendor, ‘c’ is the product, and ‘1.0.0’ is the version. All other fields are marked with an asterisk (*) to indicate that they are not applicable or unknown. 

Yes, the **Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)** is in the [2023 CWE Top 10 KEV Weaknesses list](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2023/2023_kev_list.html). It is ranked at number 3 with a score of 51.961. This says that it is a commonly exploited weakness, which aligns with its high severity. In my experience, **Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)** is a common issue in software development, especially in languages like C and C++ when I do not carefully checking it. Fix this problem is simple, from the example given above, this is the fixed version:
```
int id_sequence[4];

id_sequence[0] = 123;
id_sequence[1] = 234;
id_sequence[2] = 345;
id_sequence[3] = 456;
```

One example of a CVE related to the **Out-of-bounds Write weakness (CWE-787)** is [**CVE-2021-22750**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22750). This vulnerability exists in IGSS Definition (Def.exe) V15.0.0.21041 and prior versions. It could result in loss of data or remote code execution due to missing length checks. The related CPE for this is <br/>`cpe:2.3:a:schneider-electric:interactive_graphical_scada_system:15.0.0.21041:*:*:*:*:*:*:*`
